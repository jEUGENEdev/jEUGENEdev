        <p>Java is my first programming language that I started learning, as well as the main language that I use now. "Why did you choose this language first?" - perhaps you have such a question. Like all beginners in programming, I acted on one principle - it's to learn the coolest and most popular language, but now I can't imagine myself without my beautiful, beloved language - Java. Its syntax seems to me so correct that, sometimes, some other languages seem intimidating to me. In the future I plan to stay with Java, but also to learn all new programming languages and their technologies.</p>
