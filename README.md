    <h2>What languages do I program in at all?</h2>
    <div align="center">
        <img src="java.jpg" height="200" width="300" alt>
        <p>Java is my first programming language that I started learning, as well as the main language that I use now. "Why did you choose this language first?" - perhaps you have such a question. Like all beginners in programming, I acted on one principle - it's to learn the coolest and most popular language, but now I can't imagine myself without my beautiful, beloved language - Java. Its syntax seems to me so correct that, sometimes, some other languages seem intimidating to me. In the future I plan to stay with Java, but also to learn all new programming languages and their technologies.</p>

        <img src="front.jpg" height="200" width="300" alt>
        <p>After a relatively long study of the Java language, I had a need to try myself in Frontend. After all, this is even cooler than Backend, since you immediately observe the result of your work. It's like writing musical notes on a special piece of paper and playing a musical instrument while enjoying beautiful music. Nevertheless, I still plan to do more Backend, because there is nothing cooler than creating the logic of the application and its behavior in general. <i>And who knows, maybe FullStack will work :)</i></p>
        <br>
        <img src="python.webp" height="200" width="200" alt>
        <p>And sometimes I had to write in the Python programming language. These were mainly integrations with popular APIs of messengers and social networks, such as VKontakte, Telegram, Discord. And also <s>this is the language</s> <b>in fact, I wrote in Python and Java</b>, in which I wrote the computer science exam (EGE) this year.</p>
    </div>
    <h2>What am I planning next?</h2>
    <p>Firstly, it is to get acquainted with the Kotlin programming language, since, unfortunately, Java has faded into the background in Android development, and Kotlin is becoming more and more popular.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><b>The second thing I would like to pay attention to is the study of special tools for developers, such as: Kubernetes, Docker, Message Brokers, learn more about Linux.</b></li>
        <li><b>I am also fascinated by what is related to computer security, data protection, finding weaknesses in the code, etc. - to create products with minimal vulnerability.</b></li>
        <li><b>Once upon a time I planned to master artificial intelligence and machine learning, but I never got to that. I hope I will be able to defeat neural networks soon!</b></li>
        <li><b>And I also want to study Computer Science!</b></li>
    </ul>

    <h4>That's all, we have come to a logical conclusion. The information above will be updated as needed, well, at least I hope so))</h4>
